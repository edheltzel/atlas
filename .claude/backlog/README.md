# Feature Backlog

Ideas and features captured for future consideration. This is **not** a task list - items here are exploratory, not actionable.

## Workflow

1. **Capture** - Ideas go here with description, category, and open questions
2. **Explore** - When ready to act, create a PRD in `.claude/plans/`
3. **Execute** - PRD defines epic, milestones, and tasks

## Entry Format

Each feature is a markdown file with:

- **Title** - Clear, descriptive name
- **Category** - Maps to Atlas module system (core, voice, security, etc.)
- **Captured** - Date the idea was recorded
- **Description** - What the feature is and why it matters
- **Origin** - What sparked this idea (context for future you)
- **Open Questions** - Things to figure out before it becomes actionable
- **Related Ideas** - Links to connected backlog items
