## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is making a straightforward technical decision: restore the original file rather than fix a broken one, and ensure future changes follow PAI's recommendations. This is purely pragmatic project management - he's choosing the simpler path (restore vs. fix) and setting future workflow rules (use PAI's modification process). There's no frustration with Atlas here; Ed simply doesn't remember why the divergence happened and wants to move forward efficiently. The 'I do not want to do any PRs' is a workflow preference, not a complaint. This is Ed being direct and practical about technical decisions, which is his communication style. No sentiment toward Atlas's performance is expressed - just clear instructions about what to do next and how to handle similar situations going forward.
