## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is making a straightforward technical request to add a keyboard shortcut (cmd+k k) for clearing the terminal session in Kitty. This is a functional enhancement question with no emotional content directed at Atlas. The phrasing is polite and matter-of-fact ('can we add'), indicating a collaborative request rather than frustration with something Atlas did wrong or satisfaction with something Atlas did right. This appears to be the beginning of a new task or configuration change, not a reaction to Atlas's previous work. There are no indicators of sentiment - no frustration markers (complaints, negative words), no satisfaction markers (praise, approval), and no strong emotional language. This is simply Ed asking if a feature can be implemented, which is a neutral technical inquiry that doesn't reflect on Atlas's performance or behavior.
