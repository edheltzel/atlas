# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is giving Atlas a technical instruction to remove unused WordPress features (featured image and default text input) from a product post type. This is a straightforward cleanup request with no emotional indicators. The phrasing 'lets remove' is collaborative and matter-of-fact. There's no frustration with Atlas's previous work - Ed is simply refining the implementation by removing unnecessary fields that aren't being utilized for products. This represents normal iterative development conversation where Ed is making architectural decisions about what features to include. The request was interrupted mid-execution, but the initial message itself contains no sentiment toward Atlas's performance or capabilities. This is purely a technical directive about WordPress post type configuration.
