## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is expressing satisfaction with his Ghostty terminal keybindings and wants to ensure his WezTerm configuration has feature parity. This is a straightforward technical request - he's asking Atlas to compare two configuration files and identify gaps. There's no emotional reaction to Atlas's previous work here; instead, Ed is proactively requesting help with configuration management. The phrase 'I really like' refers to his own keybinding choices, not Atlas's work. This is a neutral command that shows Ed trusts Atlas to handle configuration analysis and migration tasks. No positive or negative sentiment toward Atlas is expressed - just a clear directive to perform a comparison task.
