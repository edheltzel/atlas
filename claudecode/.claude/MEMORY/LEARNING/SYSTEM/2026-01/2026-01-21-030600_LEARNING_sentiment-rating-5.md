## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is seeking technical clarification about where the default background image is configured in the system Atlas just modified. This is a straightforward implementation question following a code change - Ed wants to understand the current state of the system. There's no emotional content or sentiment toward Atlas's work; it's a standard follow-up question that developers ask to understand system architecture. The question suggests Ed is reviewing the changes and wants to know the complete picture of how the default value is handled, which is a normal part of the development process. This represents neutral engagement with the technical work rather than approval or disapproval of Atlas's performance.

✅ RESULTS: Background image is now customizable per product. If not set, uses the default `assets/images/backgrounds/6.png`.

📊 STATUS: Ready to use after ACF sync.
