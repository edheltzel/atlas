# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Straightforward technical request, no emotional indicators

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is requesting to add the context7 MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to the system's MCP configuration. This is a purely technical, procedural task with no emotional content directed at Atlas. The message is a clear instruction: look up documentation at code.claude.com and implement the integration. There's no frustration, satisfaction, urgency markers, or any emotional language. The tone is matter-of-fact and professional - Ed is simply assigning a task. This represents normal operational communication between Ed and his AI assistant, similar to asking a colleague to 'add this dependency to the project.' The instruction is specific (which MCP, where to find docs) indicating Ed knows what he wants and is efficiently communicating it. No praise or criticism of Atlas's prior work is present. This is baseline, emotionally-neutral task assignment that doesn't warrant a sentiment rating.
