## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is asking Atlas to perform a technical task: run GNU Stow in dry-run mode and display the paths for each directory that would be symlinked. This is a straightforward command request with no emotional indicators - no frustration about previous work, no satisfaction expressed, no complaints or praise. The word 'can you' is polite phrasing but doesn't indicate sentiment toward Atlas's performance. This is simply Ed directing Atlas to execute a specific operation. There's no context suggesting this is a follow-up to a problem or success, just a standard workflow request. The message contains no profanity, no exclamation points, no sarcasm, and no language suggesting approval or disapproval of Atlas's capabilities or past actions. It's the type of neutral request that happens throughout normal development work where Ed is simply using Atlas as a tool to accomplish a task.
