# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 4/10

**Rating:** 4/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Mild frustration - feature not working despite setup

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed has completed all the technical setup steps (synced files, uploaded JSON, configured ACF, toggled settings, confirmed child products exist) but the child products grid still isn't displaying on parent product pages. Despite Atlas committing and pushing code changes, the feature remains broken. Ed's frustration is evident in the detailed explanation of what he's already tried and verified, showing he's done his due diligence but the solution Atlas provided isn't working. He's maintaining composure and offering to provide additional debugging information (screenshots), but there's clear disappointment that after all this work, the core functionality still fails. The 'Let's use Claude in Chrome to debug' suggests he's shifting to a different tool because Atlas's solution hasn't resolved the issue. This reveals a pattern: Ed expects solutions that actually work, not just code commits. When technical implementations fail despite proper setup, it erodes confidence in the assistant's effectiveness.
