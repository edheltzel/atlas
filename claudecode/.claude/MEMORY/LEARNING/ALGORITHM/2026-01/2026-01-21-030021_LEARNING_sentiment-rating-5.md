## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is asking a straightforward technical question about file location. This is a neutral information-seeking query with no emotional indicators. He's following up on a previous explanation about WordPress admin fields, wanting to know the specific filename where those fields were implemented. There's no frustration, no satisfaction - just a developer looking for technical details to continue his work. This represents normal, emotionally-neutral technical collaboration between Ed and Atlas.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: The children grid heading fields are on the product edit screen in WordPress admin.

**Location:** Edit the product → **Children Grid** tab → fill in:
- **Section Subtitle** (e.g., "No Job Too Complex or Too Large")
- **Section Title** (e.g., "Our technology allows you to...")

**But first:** Sync the ACF JSON at **Custom Fields → Field Groups → Sync** on "Product Fields" to make the new tab appear.

🗣️ Atlas: Edit product, go to Children Grid tab, add subtitle and title fields.
