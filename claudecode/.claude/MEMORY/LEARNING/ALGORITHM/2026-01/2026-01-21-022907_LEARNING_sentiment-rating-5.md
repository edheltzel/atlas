# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Technical specification for secondary nav feature

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is providing clear technical requirements for secondary navigation functionality. He wants ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) options added for: (1) marking which nav item is active, and (2) toggling the secondary nav on/off. He also specifies that CSS classes need updating to ensure proper styling. This is a straightforward feature specification with no emotional indicators - no frustration about previous work, no excitement, just professional requirements gathering. The message tone is directive and matter-of-fact, typical of project specifications. There's no sentiment directed at Atlas's performance or capabilities; it's simply Ed defining what needs to be built next. This represents normal development workflow communication where Ed is thinking through requirements and documenting them.
