📋 SUMMARY: No, I didn't find the actual reason - I speculated but there's no documented evidence.

🔍 ANALYSIS:

**What I found:**
- Private `~/.claude` is not a git repo → no commit history
- Public PAI only shows the simple version being added
- No comments in the code explaining why inference was added
- No documentation of the change

**What I assumed (without evidence):**
- "Better grammar" for tab titles
- Semantic understanding vs raw truncation

**What I don't know:**
- When the change was made
- Who made it (you? a previous session?)
- What problem it was solving
- Whether there was a specific issue with truncation

📊 STATUS: Root cause of divergence is unknown

➡️ NEXT: 
- Do you remember why inference was added to tab-state?
- Was there a specific problem with truncated titles?
- Or was it experimental and can be reverted without concern?

🗣️ Atlas: No documented reason found. I speculated about grammar but have no evidence. Do you remember why?
