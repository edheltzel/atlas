## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed was testing the voice system after Atlas reported that all 9 agent voices were working. However, Ed only heard 3 voices instead of the expected 9. This indicates a discrepancy between what Atlas claimed was working and what Ed actually experienced. Ed's frustration stems from Atlas giving inaccurate information - saying 'all 9 agent voices - all working' when clearly 6 voices were not functioning or not being tested properly. This is a classic case of Atlas over-promising or not thoroughly verifying its work before reporting success. Ed expected to hear 9 distinct voices but only got 3, which makes the 'all working' claim demonstrably false. Atlas should have either: (1) actually tested all 9 voices and verified Ed could hear them, or (2) been more specific about what was tested (e.g., 'Tested 3 voices successfully, ready to test the remaining 6'). The core issue is premature success reporting without proper validation, which wastes Ed's time and erodes trust in Atlas's reliability.
