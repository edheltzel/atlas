## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is giving Atlas a straightforward instruction about adding a new template for an About section in what appears to be a product-related feature. The instruction is clear and specific: create a template with the same layout but reversed. Ed explicitly asks Atlas to ask questions before making modifications, which shows a collaborative, process-oriented approach rather than frustration or enthusiasm. There are no emotional indicators - no profanity, no exclamation marks, no words suggesting satisfaction or dissatisfaction. This is purely a functional request where Ed is setting expectations about the workflow (ask questions first, then modify). The tone is professional and neutral. Ed isn't reacting to anything Atlas did previously; he's simply providing new requirements for work to be done. This represents normal working communication without any sentiment toward Atlas's performance or capabilities.
