## Assistant Response Context

✅ RESULTS: Status line disabled by renaming the config key.

📊 STATUS: Ready for testing.

➡️ NEXT: 
1. **Start a new Claude Code session** (type `exit` then `claude` or open a new terminal tab)
2. **Use it for several exchanges** - especially with browser automation like you were doing
3. **Report back** - if the display stays clean, we've confirmed the status line is the cause

Once confirmed, I'll fix the script properly with:
- Explicit `tput sgr0` reset at end of output
- Proper escape seq
