## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is asking a straightforward technical question about whether a duplicate button for posts exists in the functions.php file. This is a neutral information-seeking query with no emotional content directed at Atlas. There's no indication of frustration (like 'why don't we have' or 'I can't find'), satisfaction, or any other sentiment. It's simply a factual question about the current state of the codebase. The tone is matter-of-fact and professional. This type of query is common during development work when checking on existing functionality before implementing new features or debugging. No emotional sentiment toward Atlas's performance is present.
