## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is asking Atlas a straightforward technical question about best practices for handling file modifications in a multi-repository setup (private ~/.claude and public PAI repo). The context shows Atlas had just finished analyzing divergences between the two repos. Ed's question is purely procedural - he wants to understand PAI's recommended workflow to prevent losing changes when syncing. This is a neutral, information-seeking query with no emotional indicators. It's not about Atlas's performance but about external documentation/recommendations. No frustration or satisfaction is expressed - just a logical follow-up question to maintain clean workflow.

| **Format** | `"Fixed auth bug by..."` → `"Fix
