## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed interrupted a previous request about PAI recommendations for modifications and issued a simple 'continue' command. This is a neutral process control statement - telling Atlas to resume an interrupted operation. There's no emotional valence here; it's purely functional. The message contains no indicators of satisfaction or frustration with Atlas's work. Ed is simply managing the conversation flow after deciding to let the previous request complete.
