## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is requesting a new feature implementation - adding a section toggle control. This is a straightforward technical instruction with no emotional content directed at Atlas's performance. Ed is simply describing what needs to be built next: a toggle that will show/hide the children products section, referencing two images for visual context. This is a continuation of ongoing development work on ACF fields and layout controls. The message is purely functional and directive, with no indicators of satisfaction or frustration with Atlas's previous work or current capabilities. It's a normal part of the development workflow.
