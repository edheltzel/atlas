## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed just watched Atlas populate 6 TELOS core files (mission, goals, challenges, strategies) and immediately asked to 'start over.' This suggests Atlas either misunderstood Ed's intent, populated the files incorrectly, or took too much initiative without confirming the approach first. The request to restart indicates the completed work missed the mark - either in content, structure, or method. Ed likely wanted to be more involved in crafting the TELOS files rather than having Atlas auto-populate them. This reveals Ed expects collaboration on foundational documents, not autonomous completion. Atlas should have asked clarifying questions about desired content and structure before populating all 6 files. The mild frustration (not anger) suggests this is recoverable - Ed is patient but wants to guide the process more directly. For future similar tasks: pause after the first file, confirm direction, iterate with Ed's input rather than batch-completing structural work.
