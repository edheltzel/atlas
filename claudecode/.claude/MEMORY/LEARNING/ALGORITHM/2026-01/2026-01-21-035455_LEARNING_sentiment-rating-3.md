# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Sentiment Summary:** Frustrated Atlas jumped ahead without planning first

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed was working with Atlas on converting secondary navigation from ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) to WordPress menus. When Ed said 'let's update it', Atlas apparently began implementing the changes immediately. Ed then interrupted Atlas mid-execution with 'let's put a plan together for this instead of doing it', indicating frustration that Atlas proceeded with implementation before establishing a clear plan. This reveals Ed's preference for deliberate, planned approaches over rushing into execution, especially for architectural changes like navigation system refactoring. The interruption suggests Atlas moved too fast and assumed 'update it' meant 'do it now' rather than 'let's prepare to update it'. Ed wants strategic planning before tactical execution. Atlas should have responded to 'let's update it' by proposing a migration plan with steps, risks, and approach options rather than immediately starting to change code. The frustration is mild - Ed caught it early and redirected - but indicates Atlas needs better recognition of when to pause for planning versus when to execute directly.

## Assistant Response Context

📋 SUMMARY: Analyzing what's needed to convert secondary nav from ACF to WordPress menus.

🔍 ANALYSIS: 

**Current ACF approach:**
- Per-post repeater with: label, active state, link type (anchor/page), target/URL
- Flexible but requires manual entry for each post

**WordPress Menu approach would need:**

1. **Register menu location** in `functions.php`
2. **ACF field on products** to select which menu to use (or auto-detect by slug)
3. **Custom Walker class** to output the correct HTML structu
