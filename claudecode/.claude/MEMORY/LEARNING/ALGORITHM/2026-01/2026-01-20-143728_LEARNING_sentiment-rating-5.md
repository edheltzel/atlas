## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is asking a straightforward technical question about whether the duplicate post functionality works with custom post types. This is a neutral information-seeking query with no emotional indicators toward Atlas's performance. Ed is simply following up on the previous answer about duplicate post functionality to understand its scope and compatibility with custom post types. There's no frustration, satisfaction, or any emotion directed at Atlas - just a logical next question in a technical troubleshooting conversation.
