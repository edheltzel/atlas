## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is experiencing a significant workflow disruption where a stop hook is hanging, making the CC (Claude Code/Continue) tool unusable for several seconds. This represents a clear productivity blocker that's interrupting his development flow. The frustration stems from: (1) A technical failure in the system's hook mechanism, (2) The impact being severe enough to make a core tool unusable, (3) The hang duration of 'several seconds' being long enough to disrupt workflow rhythm. Ed expects Atlas to immediately diagnose the root cause and provide a concrete action plan to fix it. The moderate rating (3) reflects that while this is clearly frustrating and problematic, Ed is calmly requesting investigation rather than expressing anger - he's in problem-solving mode but dealing with an annoying blocker. Atlas should have proactive monitoring to catch hanging hooks before they impact Ed, and should respond with: (1) Immediate diagnosis of what's causing the hang, (2) A clear remediation plan with specific steps, (3) Prevention strategy to avoid future occurrences. The request shows Ed trusts Atlas to debug complex system issues but is frustrated by preventable performance problems.
