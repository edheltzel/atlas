# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 5/10

**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Rating:** 5/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Technical instruction, no emotional content

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is providing clear technical instructions about adding a background image feature to a template and making it customizable through ACF (Advanced Custom Fields). This is a straightforward development task with no emotional indicators about Atlas's previous work. The message is matter-of-fact and task-oriented, simply stating what needs to be done next. There's no frustration about past work, no praise for what's been accomplished, just a new requirement being communicated. The 'so' at the beginning suggests continuation of work rather than reaction to something Atlas did. This is typical developer-to-developer communication style - concise, technical, focused on the next action item.
