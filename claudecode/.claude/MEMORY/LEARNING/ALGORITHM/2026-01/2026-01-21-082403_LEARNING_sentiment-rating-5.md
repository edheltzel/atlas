## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

Ed is asking Atlas to research and plan a migration strategy for moving Claude configuration files from ~/.claude to a repository structure with symlinks. He's specifically requesting that Atlas 'do not assume anything' and 'find updated docs' - this is a directive for thoroughness, not frustration. The message is methodical and planning-focused, asking about potential issues with checking config files into a repo. There's no emotional language, no indicators of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with Atlas's previous work. This is purely a technical query about best practices for a migration plan. The tone is cautious and detail-oriented ('is there anything that shouldn't be included'), which reflects Ed's careful approach to this architectural decision, not any sentiment toward Atlas's performance. No rating is appropriate here as this is a forward-looking planning question without emotional content related to Atlas's work.
