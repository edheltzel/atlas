description: "i  have everything synced including the JSON file is uploaded to the dashboard and synced with ACF. We are still not getting the grid to show on the parents even though I have it toggled on and there are children products under the parent
Let's use Claude in Chrome to debug and figure out what the issue is. You can see that the counter is showing, but the child grid is not. I can show you a picture of what the child grid is supposed to look like. If that helps, let me know.
